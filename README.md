# Bake Sale Application

This is an application I developed for Cranbrook School's Bake Sale Activities.
It is built on Electron, React and Nedb with Javascript.

## Improvements
1. UI interface needs a complete revamp
2. Sheets API? Probable
3. Change ID Images automatically (sync with server)
4. More maintainable code and improved comments
